    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking. This ensures even cooking.</li>
        <li>Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides, pressing the seasoning into the meat.</li>
        <li>Allow the steaks to sit with the seasoning for a few minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions to the pan and sauté them until they become soft and caramelized, usually taking about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once done, transfer the onions to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add the seasoned steaks and sear them on one side for about 3-4 minutes until a crust forms.</li>
        <li>Flip the steaks and sear the other side for an additional 3-4 minutes for medium-rare doneness.</li>
        <li>Adjust the cooking time according to your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and minced garlic to the pan, and baste the steaks with the melted butter and garlic.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking for another minute or two, ensuring the steaks are thoroughly coated with the garlic butter.</li>
        <li>Pour the Worcestershire sauce over the steaks, and let it cook for a minute or two, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Remove the steaks from the pan and let them rest on a cutting board for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Serve the steak slices topped with the sautéed onions and any pan juices for added flavor.</li>
    </ol>
