    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>225g spaghetti</li>
        <li>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4-6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat</li>
        <li>Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes to the oil. Cook for about 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently, until the garlic turns golden and aromatic.</li>
        <li>Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it can become bitter.</li>
        <li>Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it well, and add it to the skillet with the garlic and oil.</li>
        <li>Toss the pasta gently in the garlic oil, ensuring that the strands are well coated.</li>
        <li>Gradually add some of the reserved pasta water to the skillet, a couple of tablespoons at a time, while tossing the pasta.</li>
        <li>Continue adding the water until the desired consistency is achieved.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle chopped fresh parsley over the pasta and season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Toss everything together once more to distribute the flavors evenly.</li>
        <li>Serve the Spaghetti Aglio e Olio with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese on top, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
